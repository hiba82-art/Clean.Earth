					<h1>MITEI Presents: Advancing the Energy Transition with Joseph F. DeCarolis<h1>
					<h2>About this Event</h2>
					<p><b>Fall Colloquium</b></br><b>Stay humble and prepare for surprises: Lessons for the energy transition</b></p>
					<p>This event is for the MIT Community. <b>Please register with an MIT.edu email address.</b></p>
					<p>Please join the MIT Energy Initiative as we welcome Joseph F. DeCarolis, administrator of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, to speak about modeling and long-term projections for the energy transition. This event is part of MITEI Presents: Advancing the Energy Transition, a speaker series for the MIT community.</p>
					<p>Developing long-term energy projections is a perilous exercise: The system is governed by the laws of physics but driven by human behavior and innovation. We are already in a period of rapid change across the global energy system, which heightens uncertainty about the future. Despite the challenges, energy modeling allows us to systematically examine the future of energy. In doing so, we must always remain humble and be prepared for the inevitable surprises. In this talk, DeCarolis will provide a data-driven examination of where model-based projections went wrong in the past, current trends in energy system development, and methods to ensure that model-based insights are robust to future uncertainty.</p>
					<p>Light refreshments will follow.</p>
					<p><b>About the speaker </b></p>
					<p>Joseph DeCarolis currently serves as administrator of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the statistical agency within the U.S. Department of Energy. Prior to his current appointment, DeCarolis was professor and University Faculty Scholar in the Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering at North Carolina State University. His career and publications have centered on addressing energy and environmental challenges at the intersection of engineering, economics, and public policy, and his core research involves the development and application of energy system models to examine energy futures under uncertainty. He holds a BA in physics from Clark University and a PhD in engineering and public policy from Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
					<p><b>About the MITEI Presents: Advancing the Energy Transition speaker series</b></p>
					<p>We are in the midst of a major global shift in the types of energy we use and the ways we use them. We know that if we are to stabilize the planet‚Äôs climate and eliminate harmful emissions, we must transform our energy systems. This speaker series will connect you with energy experts and leaders who are actively working on the scientific, technological, and policy solutions we urgently need, and will explore how we must work together to accelerate this complicated process.</p>
					<p><b>Accessibility information</b></p>
					<p>MIT is committed to providing an environment that is accessible to individuals with disabilities. If you need a disability related accommodation to attend or have other questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:miteievents@mit.edu" rel="external">miteievents@mit.edu</a>.</p>
