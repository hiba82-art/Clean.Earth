					<h2>About this Event</h2>
					<p><i>Join MIT.nano for our November Nano Explorations!</i></p>
					<p><b>Zhiling Zheng</b></br>Postdoctoral Associate</br>Chemical Engineering</p>
					<p>Zhiling "Zach" Zheng will present advancements in atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) through the rational design and synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). As freshwater resources face increasing strain from climate change and population growth, AWH emerges as a promising solution, particularly in arid regions. MOFs, a class of nanomaterials with highly tunable structures and ultra-high porosity, can be engineered at the atomic level to feature hydrophilic pockets, making them ideal candidates for efficiently capturing water from the atmosphere.</p>
					<p>In this talk, Zach will first explore eco-friendly and scalable synthesis protocols for MOFs, which are essential for translating laboratory successes into real-world applications. He will also delve into the fundamental understanding of water adsorption mechanisms within MOFs, a crucial aspect for optimizing their performance in water harvesting. Building on the findings from single crystal X-ray diffraction and water vapor sorption studies, Zach will discuss the synergy between artificial intelligence (AI) and reticular chemistry, which accelerates the discovery and design of novel water-harvesting MOFs.</p>
					<p>The talk will culminate with insights from a successful field test in Death Valley National Park, where MOFs were used to extract water from air under extreme low humidity conditions, demonstrating their potential in addressing global water scarcity.</p>					
					<p>Attendees can join and participate in the series via Zoom. </p>
					<p><i>MIT.nano started Nano Explorations in 2020 as a way to keep our nano network connected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its effective sharing of knowledge and positive community impact led to the continuation of this series into today. The talks are free and open to any interested viewers.</i></p>
